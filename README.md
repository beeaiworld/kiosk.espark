## Project Overview

ESpark Mall Interactive Wayfinding is a modern digital kiosk solution designed to help visitors navigate within shopping malls. Using advanced mapping technologies, this application offers intuitive wayfinding, store location, and routing features in an elegant, user-friendly interface.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Map Navigation:** Smooth, responsive map interface with intuitive zoom, pan, and rotate controls
- **Indoor Precise Wayfinding:** Detailed indoor mapping with accurate store boundaries and locations
- **Visual Store Identification:** Color-coded store polygons with clear labeling
- **Key Point Indicators:** Clearly marked entrances/exits, escalators, and information kiosks
- **Multi-layer Visualization:** Custom polygon layers with optimized rendering
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both portrait kiosk displays and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

- **Mapbox GL JS:** Core mapping technology for high-performance vector maps
- **Custom GeoJSON Data Layers:** Precisely defined store polygons and points of interest
- **Layer Management:** Multiple interactive map layers with custom styling
- **Dynamic Feature Rendering:** Performant rendering of complex indoor layouts
- **Custom Overlay System:** Specially designed icons and markers for mall facilities

### Development Approach

The application is built using a component-based architecture focusing on:

1. **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring smooth map rendering even with complex polygon data
2. **Data Structure Design:** Carefully organized GeoJSON for optimal map visualization
3. **User Experience:** Intuitive controls and clear visual hierarchy
4. **Layout Architecture:** Designed for both portrait kiosk displays and mobile web compatibility

## Example Implementation

This implementation showcases:

- Precise indoor mapping of an actual shopping mall floor plan
- Multiple store locations with accurate boundaries
- Clear visual identification system
- Supporting infrastructure elements (entrances, exits, escalators)
- Information points for visitor assistance

## Deployment

The application is designed for deployment on:

- Touch-screen kiosks (primarily portrait orientation)
- Web servers for mobile device access
- Standalone installations within mall environments

## Future Enhancements

- Path routing between selected locations
- Multi-floor navigation capabilities
- Real-time store promotions integration
- Accessibility features for users with disabilities
- Multi-language support with RTL compatibility
